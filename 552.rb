# QUESTION 1
# Write a method that takes in three strings and uses string interpolation 
# to return all three strings combined with spaces in between as a single string. 
# Then run the method and print the result.



def combine_strings(str1, str2, str3)
    "#{str1} #{str2} #{str3}"
  end
  
  result = combine_strings("Hello", "Master", "im using ruby")
  puts result
  
  # this was kinda hard to figure out
