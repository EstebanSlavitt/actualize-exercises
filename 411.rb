# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
# For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].


numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]


odd_numbers = []

numbers.each do |number|
  odd_numbers.push(number) if number.odd?
end
