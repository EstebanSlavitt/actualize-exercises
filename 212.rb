# Then add the two variables together (by converting the number to a string) and 
# store the result in a third variable. Finally, print out the third variable.

# text = " It's really pretty outside"
# result = number.to_s + text
# puts result

# got a little confused is this the answer i'm looking for "42 It's really pretty outside"

# The code below has a mistake in it. Run the code to see the error message,
# then explain what the error message means and what would need to change to fix it.
# x = 10
# puts x + y  # y is not defined so we need to define it before we print it.
